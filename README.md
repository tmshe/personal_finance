I created the script to help me manage my personal fiance. I enjoyed using Mint to keep an eye on the expenses and budgeting. Unfortunately, Mint left Canada market. What's better to do than create my own script. 
The script take in bank statements (csv and pdf) and clean them up. Then I used a pre-train BERT model to classify each transaction.
